## 2. What is Node.js?
Node.js is a very popular scripting language that is primarily used for server-side scripting requirements. It has numerous benefits compared to other server-side programming languages out there, the most noteworthy one being the non-blocking I/O.

## 3. Briefly explain the working of Node.js.
Node.js is an entity that runs in a virtual environment, using JavaScript as the primary scripting language. It uses a simple V8 environment to run on, which helps in the provision of features like the non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop.

## 4. Where is Node.js used?
Node.js is used in a variety of domains. But, it is very well regarded in the design of the following concepts:

Network application
Distributed computing
Responsive web apps
Server–Client applications
Next up on these Node js interview questions, you have to understand a very vital difference. Read on.

## 5. What is the difference between Node.js and Angular?
Node.js	Angular
Used in situations where scalability is a requirement	Best fit for the development of real-time applications
Ability to generate queries in a database	Ability to simplify an application into the MVC architecture
Mainly used to develop small/medium-sized applications	Mainly used to develop real-time interactive web applications
Provides many frameworks such as Sails, Partial, and Express	Angular is an all-in-one web app framework

## 6. Why is Node.js single-threaded?
Node.js works on the single-threaded model to ensure that there is support for asynchronous processing. With this, it makes it scalable and efficient for applications to provide high performance and efficiency under high amounts of load.

## 7. What are the different API functions supported by Node.js?
There are two types of API functions. They are as follows:

Synchronous APIs: Used for non-blocking functions
Asynchronous APIs: Used for blocking functions
## 8. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions?
Synchronous functions are mainly used for I/O operations. They are instantaneous in providing a response to the data movement in the server and keep up with the data as per the requirement. If there are no responses, then the API will throw an error.

On the other hand, asynchronous functions, as the name suggests, work on the basis of not being synchronous. Here, HTTP requests when pushed will not wait for a response to begin. Responses to any previous requests will be continuous even if the server has already got the response.

Next among the Node js questions, we have to check out about control flow function.

## 9. What is the control flow function?
The control flow function is a common code snippet, which executes whenever there are any asynchronous function calls made, and they are used to evaluate the order in which these functions are executed in Node.js.


## 10. Why is Node.js so popular these days?
Node.js has gained an immense amount of traction as it mainly uses JavaScript. It provides programmers with the following options:

Writing JavaScript on the server
Access to the HTTP stack
File I/O entities
TCP and other protocols
Direct database access
## 11. What is an event loop in Node.js?
When running an application, callbacks are entities that have to be handled. In the case of Node.js, event loops are used for this purpose. Since Node.js supports the non-blocking send, this is a very important feature to have.

The working of an event loop begins with the occurrence of a callback wherever an event begins. This is usually run by a specific listener. Node.js will keep executing the code after the functions have been called, without expecting the output prior to the beginning.

Once, all of the code is executed, outputs are obtained and the callback function is executed. This works in the form of a continuous loop, hence the name event loop.

## 12. What are the asynchronous tasks that should occur in an event loop?
Following are some of the tasks that can be done using an event loop asynchronously:

Blocking send requests
High computational requirement
Real-time I/O operations
## 13. What is the order of execution in control flow statements?
The following is the order in which control flow statements are used to process function calls:

Handling execution and queue
Data collection and storage
Concurrency handling and limiting
Execution of the next piece of code
## 14. What are the input arguments for an asynchronous queue?
There are two main arguments that an asynchronous queue uses. They are:

Concurrency value
Task function
## 15. Are there any disadvantages to using Node.js?
A multi-threaded platform can run more effectively and provide better responsiveness when it comes to the execution of intensive CPU computation, and the usage of relational databases with Node.js is becoming obsolete already.

16. What is the primary reason to use the event-based model in Node.js?
The event-based model in Node.js is used to overcome the problems that occur when using blocking operations in the I/O channel.

return x + y;
}
var result = add(3,5);
assert( result === 8, 'three summed with five is eight');
29. What are stubs in Node.js?
Stubs are simply functions that are used to assess and analyze individual component behavior. When running test cases, stubs are useful in providing the details of the functions executed.

30. How is a test pyramid implemented using the HTML API in Node.js?
Test pyramids are implemented by defining the HTML API. This is done using the following:

A higher number of unit test cases
A smaller number of integration test methods
A fewer number of HTTP endpoint test cases
31. Why is a buffer class used in Node.js?
A buffer class is primarily used as a way to store data in Node.js. This can be considered as a similar implementation of arrays or lists. Here, the class refers to a raw memory location that is not present in the V8 heap structure.

The buffer class is global, thereby extending its usage across all the modules of an application.

32. Why is ExpressJS used?
ExpressJS is a widely used framework built using Node.js. Express.js uses a management point that controls the flow of data between servers and server-side applications.

Passport is a widely used middleware present in Node.js. It is primarily used for authentication, and it can easily fit into any Express.js-based web application.

With every application created, it will require unique authentication mechanisms. This is provided as single modules by using passport, and it becomes easy to assign strategies to applications based on requirements, thereby avoiding any sort of dependencies.

## 42. How to get information about a file in Node.js?
The fs.stat function is used to get the required information from a file.

The syntax is as follows:

fs.stat(path, callback)
where,

Path is the string that has the path to the name
Callback: The callback function where stats is an object of fs.stats

## 43. How does the DNS lookup function work in Node.js?
The DNS lookup method uses a web address for its parameter and returns the IPv4 or IPv6 record, correspondingly.

There are other parameters such as the options that are used to set the input as an integer or an object. If nothing is provided here, both IPv4 and IPv6 are considered. The third parameter is for the callback function.

The syntax is:

dns.lookup(address, options, callback)
## 44. What is the use of EventEmitter in Node.js?
Every single object in Node.js that emits is nothing but an instance of the EventEmitter class. These objects have a function that is used to allow the attachment between the objects and the named events.

Synchronous attachments of the functions are done when the EventEmitter object emits an event.

## 45. What is the difference between setImmediate() and setTimeout()?
The setImmediate() function is meant to execute a single script once the current event loop is complete.

The setTimeout() function is used to hold a script and schedule it to be run after a certain time threshold is over.

The order of execution will solely depend on the context in which the functions are called. If called from the main module, the timing will be based on the performance of the process.

## 46. What is the use of module.exports in Node.js?
The module.exports function is used to expose two functions and bring them to a usable context. A module is an entity that is used to store relative code in a single snippet. This can be considered as an operation of moving all of the functions into one single file.
